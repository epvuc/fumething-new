make measurement_task() use the global configuration var "interval" for its timing.

use dest_ip and dest_port for the udp report target in network.c
	read values from NVS on startup
	if there are none, set them to the built-in defaults
	if changed via web api, write them to NVS and reboot

make the api return current data in json and implement changing the config values

add api call to turn onboard LED on and off

read the button on the board on power up and wipe wifi config if it's held down
	so you can re-provision

	ok reading the button works. As an experiment i just threw in a goto to 
	just before wifi_prov_mgr_start_provisioning(), it does go through the
	process and kinda works - it crashes, then restarts and uses the new creds
	but obviously this is not a solution :) 

	it crashes when the event handler tries to re-add the mdns service and httpd
	service after the reprovisioning succeeds, since they weren't removed beforehand.



add task watchdog to the hardware thread
